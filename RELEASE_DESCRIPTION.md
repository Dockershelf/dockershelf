*Dockershelf* is a repository that serves as a collector for docker recipes that are universal, efficient and slim. We keep adding "shelves", which are holders for the different versions of a popular language or application. Images are updated, tested and published *weekly* via a [Github Actions workflow](https://github.com/Dockershelf/dockershelf/actions). All images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/dockershelf).
